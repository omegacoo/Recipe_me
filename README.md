# Pantry Buddy

> A new project for taking what ingredients the user has on hand and returning all the recipes they are able to make with those ingredients.

## Motivation

> Sometimes I've just wanted to know what I could cook with what I have on hand. I couldn't find a good site that met this need, so I decided to try my hand at it.
